# MemoryGame
As its name says, it's needed some concentration and memory for playing this.
The game consists in trying to memorize the largest sequence of LEDs that will blink.
You can use a buzzer in the circuit - when it starts to annoy you (believe me, it's' not going to take long), you can restart the game and choose for desactivate the sound - making the experience funnier and easier to remember the LEDs (after all, notice that the frequences is related with the colors).
It's permitted also to use buttons or just your keyboard.
Have fun!
